# Linux Kernel

**The Linux kernel** is the core component of the Linux operating system. It serves as the bridge between the hardware and the software, providing essential functionalities such as process management, memory management, device drivers, and system calls.

# Linux Kernel for QEMU vexpress


## Clone the Main Repository

### 1. To clone the main Linux kernel repository, use the following command:

```bash
# you can either choose the linux kernel version and download it or clone the last commit
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/torvalds/linux.git
```
### 2. Use a Repository for QEMU vexpress

**Alternatively,** you can use a repository specifically configured for running QEMU vexpress virtual machines. This repository includes additional configuration and patches optimized for the vexpress platform.

### To clone the repository for QEMU vexpress, use the following command:
```bash
# you can either choose the linux kernel version and download it or clone the last commit
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/qemu/qemu.git
```

## Building the Kernel

**Once you have cloned the repository,** you can build the Linux kernel for the QEMU vexpress platform using the following commands:
```bash
cd linux[version] 
make vexpress_defconfig ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=<Path To the Compiler>/arm-cortexa9_neon-linux-musleabihf-
make menuconfig ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=<Path To the Compiler>/arm-cortexa9_neon-linux-musleabihf-
make zImage modules dtbs ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=<Path To the Compiler>/arm-cortexa9_neon-linux-musleabihf- -j$(nproc)
```

## Running QEMU with the Kernel

**After building the kernel,** you can run QEMU with the vexpress platform and specify the built kernel image:
