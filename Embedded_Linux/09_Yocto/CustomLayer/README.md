Recipes
------------

Recipes are fundamental components in the Yocto Project environment.

A Yocto/OpenEmbedded recipe is a text file with file extension .bb

Each software component built by the OpenEmbedded build system requires a recipe to define the component

A recipe contains information about single piece of software.

What information is present in a recipe?
----------------------------------------

Information such as:

        Location from which to download the unaltered source
        any patches to be applied to that source (if needed)
        special configuration options to apply
        how to compile the source files and
        how to package the compiled output

Poky includes several classes that abstract the process for the most common development tools as projects based on Autotools, CMake, and QMake.


Recipe File Format
---------------------

File Format: <base_name>_<version>.bb

Note: Use lower-cased characters and do not include the reserved suffixes -native, -cross, -initial, or -dev


Bitbake
------------

Yocto/OpenEmbedded's build tool bitbake parses a recipe and generates list of tasks that it can execute to perform the build steps

$ bitbake basename

The most important tasks are

do_fetch             Fetches the source code
do_unpack            Unpacks the source code into a working directory
do_patch             Locates patch files and applies them to the source code
do_configure         Configures the source by enabling and disabling any build-time and
                         configuration options for the software being built
do_compile           Compiles the source in the compilation directory
do_install           Copies files from the compilation directory to a holding area
do_package           Analyzes the content of the holding area and splits it into subsets
                         based on available packages and files
do_package_write_rpm Creates the actual RPM packages and places them in the Package Feed area

Generally, the only tasks that the user needs to specify in a recipe are 
	do_configure,
	do_compile and 
	do_install ones. 

The remaining tasks are automatically defined by the YP build system

The above task list is in the correct dependency order. They are executed from top to bottom.

You can use the -c argument to execute the specific task of a recipe.

$ bitbake -c compile dropbear

To list all tasks of a particular recipe

$ bitbake <recipe name> -c listtasks



Stage 1: Fetching Code (do_fetch)
----------------------------------

The first thing your recipe must do is specify how to fetch the source files.

Fetching is controlled mainly through the SRC_URI variable

Your recipe must have a SRC_URI variable that points to where the source is located.

The SRC_URI variable in your recipe must define each unique location for your source files.

Bitbake supports fetching source code from git, svn, https, ftp, etc

URI scheme syntax: scheme://url;param1;param2

scheme can describe a local file using file:// or remote locations with https://, git://, svn://, hg://, ftp://

By default, sources are fetched in $BUILDDIR/downloads

Examples of SRC_URI
----------------------

busybox_1.31.0.bb  : SRC_URI = "https://busybox.net/downloads/busybox-${PV}.tar.bz2"

linux-yocto_5.2.bb : SRC_URI = "git://git.yoctoproject.org/linux-yocto.git"

weston-init.bb	   : SRC_URI = "file://init"

The do_fetch task uses the prefix of each entry in the SRC_URI variable value to determine how to fetch the source code.

Note: Any patch files present, needs to be specified in SRC_URI



Stage 2: Unpacking (do_unpack)
-------------------------------

All local files found in SRC_URI are copied into the recipeâ€™s working directory, in $BUILDDIR/tmp/work/

When extracting a tarball,BitBake expects to find the extracted files in a directory named <application>-<version>. This is controlled by the S variable.

If the tarball follows the above format, then you need not define S variable

Eg. SRC_URI = "https://busybox.net/downloads/busybox-${PV}.tar.bz2;name=tarball

If the directory has another name, you must explicitly define S

If you are fetching from SCM like git or SVN, or your file is local to your machine, you need to define S

If the scheme is git, S = ${WORKDIR}/git

Stage 3: Patching Code (do_patch)
---------------------------------

Sometimes it is necessary to patch code after it has been fetched.

Any files mentioned in SRC_URI whose names end in .patch or .diff or compressed versions of these suffixes (e.g. diff.gz) are treated as patches

The do_patch task automatically applies these patches.

The build system should be able to apply patches with the "-p1" option (i.e. one directory level in the path will be stripped off).

If your patch needs to have more directory levels stripped off, specify the number of levels using the "striplevel" option in the SRC_URI entry for the patch



Stage 3: Patching Code (do_patch)
---------------------------------

Sometimes it is necessary to patch code after it has been fetched.

Any files mentioned in SRC_URI whose names end in .patch or .diff or compressed versions of these suffixes (e.g. diff.gz) are treated as patches

The do_patch task automatically applies these patches.

The build system should be able to apply patches with the "-p1" option (i.e. one directory level in the path will be stripped off).

If your patch needs to have more directory levels stripped off, specify the number of levels using the "striplevel" option in the SRC_URI entry for the patch


Stage 3: Patching Code (do_patch)
---------------------------------

If your patch needs to have more directory levels stripped off, specify the number of levels using the "striplevel" option in the SRC_URI entry for the patch


Stage 5: Compilation (do_compile)
---------------------------------

do_compile task happens after source is fetched, unpacked, and configured.

Stage 6: Installation (do_install)
------------------------------------

After compilation completes, BitBake executes the do_install task

During do_install, the task copies the built files along with their hierarchy to locations that would mirror their locations on the target device.

Stage 7: Packaging (do_package)
--------------------------------

The do_package task splits the files produced by the recipe into logical components.

Even software that produces a single binary might still have debug symbols, documentation, and other logical components that should be split out.

The do_package task ensures that files are split up and packaged correctly.

Step 1: Create a file userprog.c with the following content:

#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
	printf("Hello World\n");
	return 0;
}

Step 2: Create a folder in the layer recipes-example 'myhello'
	mkdir -p recipes-examples/myhello

Step 3: Create 'files' folder inside the 'myhello' folder and copy userprog.c inside this folder
	mkdir -p recipes-examples/myhello/files
	Copy the userprog.c into the above location

Step 4: Create a file called 'myhello_0.1.bb' with the following content:

	DESCRIPTION = "Simple helloworld application"
	LICENSE = "MIT"
	LIC_FILES_CHKSUM = "file://${COMMON_LICENSE_DIR}/MIT;md5=0835ade698e0bcf8506ecda2f7b4f302"

	SRC_URI = "file://userprog.c"

	S = "${WORKDIR}"

	do_compile() {
		${CC} userprog.c ${LDFLAGS} -o userprog
	}	

	do_install() {
		install -d ${D}${bindir}
		install -m 0755 userprog ${D}${bindir}
	}

Step 5: bitbake myhello


install keyword
-----------------

install not only copies files but also changes its ownership and permissions and optionally removes debugging symbols from executables.

It combines cp with chown, chmod and strip

WORKDIR
--------------

The location of the work directory in which the OpenEmbedded build system builds a recipe.

This directory is located within the TMPDIR directory structure and is specific to the recipe being built and the system for which it is being built.

The WORKDIR directory is defined as follows:

${TMPDIR}/work/${MULTIMACH_TARGET_SYS}/${PN}/${EXTENDPE}${PV}-${PR}

TMPDIR: The top-level build output directory
MULTIMACH_TARGET_SYS: The target system identifier
PN: The recipe name
EXTENDPE: Mostly blank
PV: The recipe version
PR: The recipe revision



OpenEmbedded Variables
----------------------

S : Contains the unpacked source files for a given recipe

D : The destination directory (root directory of where the files are installed, before creating the image)

WORKDIR: The location where the OpenEmbedded build system builds a recipe (i.e. does the work to create the package).

PN : The name of the recipe used to build the package

PV : The version of the recipe used to build the package

PR : The revision of the recipe used to build the package.

Recipe Explanation
-----------------------
The most relevant tasks that will be executed when calling bitbake myhello are the following:

$ bitbake -c cleanall myhello

1. do_fetch: 
	in this case, since the specified SRC_URI variable points to a local file, BitBake will simply copy the file in the recipe WORKDIR. 
	This is why the S environment variable (which represents the source code location) is set to WORKDIR.

$ bitbake -c fetch myhello
$ bitbake -c unpack myhello
$ bitbake -c configure myhello
	
What is sysroot?
---------------
contain needed headers and libraries for generating binaries that run on the target architecture

recipe-sysroot-native:
	includes the build dependencies used in the host system during the build process.
	It is critical to the cross-compilation process because it encompasses the compiler, linker, build script tools, and more,

recipe-sysroot:
	the libraries and headers used in the target code

2. do_compile: 
	when executing this task, BB will invoke the C cross-compiler for compiling the myhello.c source file. 
	The results of the compilation will be in the folder pointed by the B environment variable (that, in most of the cases, is the same as the S folder).

3. do_install: 
	this task specifies where the helloworld binary should be installed into the rootfs. 
	It must be noticed that this installation will only happen within a temporary rootfs folder within the recipe WORKDIR (pointed by the variable D)

	image: This contains the files installed by the recipe (pointed to D variable).

4. do_package: 
	in this phase the file installed in the directory D will be packaged in a package named myhello. 
	This package will be used later from BitBake when eventually building a rootfs image containing the helloworld recipe package

	packages: The extracted contents of packages are stored here
	packages-split: The contents of packages, extracted and split, are stored here. This has a sub-directory for each package
	
Add the recipe to rootfs

IMAGE_INSTALL += "myhello"


Who defines the fetch, configure and other tasks 
-------------------------------------------------

When bitbake is run to build a recipe, base.bbclass file gets inherited automatically by any recipe

You can find it in classes/base.bbclass

This class contains definitions for standard basic tasks such as fetching, unpacking, configuring (empty by default), compiling (runs any Makefile present), installing (empty by default) and packaging (empty by default)

These classes are often overridden or extended by other classes such as the autotools class or the package class.
