# CrossTool-NG Configuration

## Introduction

This README provides a brief overview and instructions for configuring CrossTool-NG, a powerful cross-compilation toolchain generator. CrossTool-NG allows you to build a custom toolchain for your embedded system development needs.

## Installation

To install CrossTool-NG, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the CrossTool-NG repository from GitHub:
    git clone https://github.com/crosstool-ng/crosstool-ng	
    
### 2. Navigate to the CrossTool-NG directory:
    cd crosstool-ng

### 3. Install Dependencies:
    sudo apt install -y gcc g++ gperf bison flex texinfo help2man make libncurses5-dev python3-dev autoconf automake libtool-bin gawk wget bzip2 xz-utils unzip patch libstdc++6 rsync
    
### 4. Configure and compile CrossTool-NG:
    ./bootstrap                          ===>> To setup the environment
    ./configure --enable-local           ===>> To check all dependency
    make                                 ===>> To generate the Makefile for croostool-ng

## Configuration

Follow these steps to configure CrossTool-NG:

### 1. List default configured Toolchains for supproted architecture:
    /ct-ng list-samples                   ===>> To list all microcontrollers supported


### 2. Choose toolchain for required architecture:
    ./ct-ng [microcontroller]             ===>> To configure the microcontroller used    

### 3. Initialize the CrossTool-NG configuration to change in the default configuration:
    ./ct-ng menuconfig                    ===>> To configure toolchain

## Building the Toolchain

### Once you've configured CrossTool-NG, you can build the toolchain by running:
    ./ct-ng build

## Usage

After the build process completes successfully, you can find your custom toolchain in the directory specified during configuration (usually ~/x-tools by default). Use this toolchain with your embedded development projects to cross-compile your code for your target platform.

## Components of a toolchain

## a) Binutils

Binutils is a collection of binary tools used for creating, manipulating, and managing object files, libraries, and executables in a software development environment. These tools are essential components of a toolchain, especially in the context of compiling and linking code.

## Components

### 1. Assembler (`as`)
Converts assembly language code into machine-readable object files.

### 2. Linker (`ld`)
Links multiple object files together to create an executable or a library. It resolves symbols, such as function calls, across different object files.

### 3. Object File Utilities
- **Object Copy (`objcopy`)**: Copies and converts object files between different formats.
- **Object Dump (`objdump`)**: Displays information about object files, such as sections, symbols, and disassembly.
- **Archive Manipulation (`ar`)**: Creates, modifies, and extracts files from static libraries.

### 4. Debugging Utilities
- **Symbol Table Manipulation (`nm`)**: Lists symbols from object files.
- **Source Level Debugger (`gdb`) Integration**: Binutils provides support for GDB, the GNU Debugger, enabling source-level debugging of compiled programs.

### 5. Binary File Format Utilities
- **Binary File Format Conversion (`readelf`)**: Displays information about ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) files.
- **Executable Strip (`strip`)**: Removes unnecessary information from executables and shared libraries, reducing their size.

## b) Kernel Headers

Kernel headers provide the necessary header files that define the structures and constants required for building kernel modules and certain user-space programs that interact with the Linux kernel.

### Purpose

The kernel headers serve several purposes:
- They define data structures and constants used by the kernel and kernel modules.
- They allow user-space programs to interface with the kernel through system calls and other interfaces.
- They provide essential information for compiling kernel modules.

### Components

The kernel headers typically include header files for various subsystems of the Linux kernel, such as:
- **Linux Kernel APIs**: Definitions for system calls, data structures, and constants.
- **Device Drivers**: Headers for interfacing with device drivers and hardware.
- **Networking**: Definitions for network protocols, sockets, and network device interfaces.
- **File Systems**: Headers related to file system operations and structures.
- **Processor Architecture**: Architecture-specific headers for different processor families.

### Usage

Kernel headers are used primarily during the compilation of kernel modules and certain user-space programs.

### ===========================================================================

### Sysroot

**Sysroot, short for system root,** is a directory structure that mimics the root filesystem of the target system. It contains essential libraries, headers, and other files necessary for compiling and linking applications targeted for the specific platform. Crosstool-NG generates this sysroot as part of the toolchain setup process.

**Sysroot plays a vital role** in cross-compilation by providing the necessary environment for building software. When compiling code, the compiler needs access to header files and libraries specific to the target platform. Sysroot ensures that these dependencies are available to the cross-compiler, allowing it to produce binaries compatible with the target system.

### Components of Sysroot

`lib:` Contains the shared objects for the C library and the dynamic linker/loader, ld-linux

`usr/lib:` The static library archive files for the C library, and any other libraries that may be installed subsequently

`usr/include:` Contains the headers for all the libraries

`usr/bin:` Contains the utility programs that run on the target,such as the ldd command

`usr/share:` Used for localization and internationalization

`sbin:` Provides the ldconfig utility, used to optimize library loading paths

### ===========================================================================

## Test the generated toolchain for avr

## 1. write source code: 
    vim main.c
    
## 2. add toolchain to PATH environment variable:     
    export PATH=${PATH}:~/x-tools/avr/bin

## 3. Compile the source code: 
  **Note:** Specify the hardware using -mmcu= 
  
    avr-gcc main.c -mmcu=atmega32a -O1 -o main
